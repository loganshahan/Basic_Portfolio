            <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/img_logan.jpg" ALIGN="left"/>
            <p>I am a dedicated government employee looking to enter a new career field in development, who has gained valuable experience working in different environments across the world.  I bring a strong work ethic and personable approach to my work no matter the task.  Working in high-intensity jobs with soldiers has made me highly adaptable with a will to succeed at all cost.  My educational background from James Madison University as well as the knowledge I have gained from George Washington University has equipped me to work in the Web Development field.   The front end development skills I have learned such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node have positioned me for this line of work and every day I am looking to improve upon my knowledge.  I look forward to continuing my journey in Web Development.</p>
