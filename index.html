                <span id="bio-image"><img src="img_logan.jpg" alt="Logan Shahan"></span>

                <p>I was born and raised in Heidelberg, Germany near an US Army base. I attended school on the base but lived in the local surrounding community. After high school I attended James Madison University. Upon graduation I moved back to Heidelberg and started working for the US government supporting the Army.  I moved here to three years ago to continue my work for the government in the Pentagon. </p>
            
                <P>I have an identical twin who is 4 minutes older than me. I am an avid sports fan and my favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys. My hobbies include travelling, snowboarding, watching sports, and enjoying a fine German bier. Prost!</P>
